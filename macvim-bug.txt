FZF's CTRL-P command throws up a macvim terminal window in the current window when it lists its files.

Somewhere between snapshot-127 and snapshot-137 that list started being corrupted by incomplete escape sequences.

Repeat by:

Load vim with the following minimal .vimrc:

set nocompatible " no compatibility with legacy vi (also req'd for Vundle)
if !empty(glob("~/.vim/bundle/Vundle.vim/*"))
  filetype off     " Vundle needs this off for initialization
  "" Intialize Vundle and load plugins.  See ":h vundle" for more info.
  set runtimepath+=~/.vim/bundle/Vundle.vim
  call vundle#begin()
  Plugin 'gmarik/Vundle.vim'

  Plugin 'junegunn/fzf'
    map <c-p> :FZF<CR>

  call vundle#end() " end of Vundle plugin list
  filetype plugin on " required by Vundle
  filetype indent on " required by Vundle
endif


Then start gvim from a directory containing some longer relative directory names in its hierarchy and click the CTRL-P.

Notice that the screen gets garbled during certain key exchanges and that this is not consistent.
